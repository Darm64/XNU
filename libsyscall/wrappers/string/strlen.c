/*
 * Portable strlen() for 32-bit and 64-bit systems.
 *
 * Rationale: it is generally much more efficient to do word length
 * operations and avoid branches on modern computer systems, as
 * compared to byte-length operations with a lot of branches.
 *
 * The expression:
 *
 *	((x - 0x01....01) & ~x & 0x80....80)
 *
 * would evaluate to a non-zero value iff any of the bytes in the
 * original word is zero.  However, we can further reduce ~1/3 of
 * time if we consider that strlen() usually operate on 7-bit ASCII
 * by employing the following expression, which allows false positive
 * when high bit of 1 and use the tail case to catch these case:
 *
 *	((x - 0x01....01) & 0x80....80)
 *
 * This is more than 5.2 times as fast as the raw implementation on
 * Intel T7300 under long mode for strings longer than word length.
