/*
 * Purgeable spelling rules
 * It is believed that the correct spelling is 
 * { 'p', 'u', 'r', 'g', 'e', 'a', 'b', 'l', 'e' }.
 * However, there is one published API that likes to spell it without the
 * first 'e', vm_purgable_control(). Since we can't change that API,
 * here are the rules.
 * All qualifiers defined in vm_purgable.h are spelled without the e.
 * All other qualifiers are spelled with the e.
 * Right now, there are remains of the wrong spelling throughout the code,
 * vm_object_t.purgable for example. We expect to change these on occasion.
