/*!
 *  1. Introduction
 *
 *  IOReporting is a mechanism for I/O Kit drivers to gather statistics
 *  (or other information) and make it available to various "observers,"
 *  which are generally in user space. Requests for information come
 *  through two new IOService methods: ::configureReport(...) and
 *  ::updateReport(...). While not required (see IOReportTypes.h), drivers
 *  will generally use IOReporter subclass instances to track the requested
 *  information and respond to IOReporting requests. Drivers can use these
 *  classes to track information, either all the time or between "enable"
 *  and "disable" calls to IOService::configureReport().
 *
 *  Available information is organized into "channels." A channel is
 *  uniquely identified by both driver (registry) ID and a 64-bit channel
 *  ID. One way drivers can advertise their channels is by publishing
 *  "legends" in the I/O Kit registry. In addition to collecting
 *  information and responding to queries, IOReporter objects can produce
 *  legend entries describing their channels. The IOReportLegend class
 *  helps manage legend entries from multiple reporter objects as well
 *  as with grouping channels logically for observers.
 *
 *  An important basic constraint of the current implementation is that
 *  all channels reported by a particular reporter instance must share all
 *  traits except channel ID and name.  Specifically, the channel type
 *  (including report class, categories, & size) and units.  Additionally,
 *  IOHistogramReporter currently only supports one channel at a time.
 *
 *  Currently, ::{configure/update}Report() can be called any time between
 *  when a driver calls registerService() and when free() is called on
 *  your driver. 12960947 tracks improvements / recommendations for
 *  correctly handling these calls during termination.
 *
 * Locking
 *  IOReporting only imposes concurrent access constraints when multiple
 *  threads are accessing the same object.  Three levels of constraint apply
 *  depending on a method's purpose:
 *  1. Allocation/Teardown - same-instance concurrency UNSAFE, MAY BLOCK
 *  2. Configuration - same-instance concurrency SAFE, MAY BLOCK
 *  3. Update - same-instance concurrency SAFE, WILL NOT BLOCK
 *
 *  Configuration requires memory management which can block and must
 *  be invoked with interrupts ENABLED (for example, NOT in the interrupt
 *  context NOR with a spin lock -- like IOSimpleLock -- held).
 *
 *  Updates can be performed with interrupts disabled, but clients should
 *  take into account that IOReporters' non-blocking currenency is achieved
 *  with IOSimpleLockLockDisable/UnlockEnableInterrupts(): that is, by
 *  disabling interrupts and taking a spin lock.  While IOReporting will
 *  never hold a lock beyond a call into it, some time may be spent within
 *  the call spin-waiting for the lock.  Clients holding their own
 *  spin locks should carefully consider the impact of IOReporting's
 *  (small) additional latency before calling it while holding a spin lock.
 *
 *  The documentation for each method indicates any concurrency guarantees.

 *
 *       Subclasses should ensure that this lock is taken exactly once
 *       before directly accessing reporter data.  For example,

 *       it from ::handle*() methods which exist to allow override after

 *   @discussion
 *       Similar to setState(), setStateByIndices() sets a channel's state
 *       without searching for the channel or state IDs.  It will perform
 *       bounds checking, but relies on the caller to properly indicate
 *       the indices of the channel and state.  Clients can rely on channels
 *       being added to IOStateReporter in order: the first channel will
 *       have index 0, the second index 1, etc.  Like ::setState(),
 *       "time in state" calculations are handled automatically.
 *
 *       setStateByIndices() is faster than than setChannelState(), but
 *       it should only be used where the latter's performance overhead
 *       might be a problem.  For example, many channels in a single
 *       reporter and high-frequency state changes.
 *
 *       Drivers wishing to compute and report their own time in state
 *       should use incrementChannelState() or overrideChannelState().  It
 *       is not currently possible for a driver to synchronize with the
 *       automatic time-keeping enabled by setStateByIndices().  The
 *       4-argument version of setChannelState() is thus impossible to
 *       use correctly.  In the future, there may be a setChannelState()
 *       which accepts a last_intransition parameter and uses it to
 *       automatically calculate time in state (ERs -> IOReporting / X).
