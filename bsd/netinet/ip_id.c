/*
 * IP ID generation is a fascinating topic.
 *
 * In order to avoid ID collisions during packet reassembly, common sense
 * dictates that the period between reuse of IDs be as large as possible.
 * This leads to the classic implementation of a system-wide counter, thereby
 * ensuring that IDs repeat only once every 2^16 packets.
 *
 * Subsequent security researchers have pointed out that using a global
 * counter makes ID values predictable.  This predictability allows traffic
 * analysis, idle scanning, and even packet injection in specific cases.
 * These results suggest that IP IDs should be as random as possible.
 *
 * The "searchable queues" algorithm used in this IP ID implementation was
 * proposed by Amit Klein.  It is a compromise between the above two
 * viewpoints that has provable behavior that can be tuned to the user's
 * requirements.
 *
 * The basic concept is that we supplement a standard random number generator
 * with a queue of the last L IDs that we have handed out to ensure that all
 * IDs have a period of at least L.
 *
 * To efficiently implement this idea, we keep two data structures: a
 * circular array of IDs of size L and a bitstring of 65536 bits.
 *
 * To start, we ask the RNG for a new ID.  A quick index into the bitstring
 * is used to determine if this is a recently used value.  The process is
 * repeated until a value is returned that is not in the bitstring.
 *
 * Having found a usable ID, we remove the ID stored at the current position
 * in the queue from the bitstring and replace it with our new ID.  Our new
 * ID is then added to the bitstring and the queue pointer is incremented.
 *
 * The lower limit of 512 was chosen because there doesn't seem to be much
 * point to having a smaller value.  The upper limit of 32768 was chosen for
 * two reasons.  First, every step above 32768 decreases the entropy.  Taken
 * to an extreme, 65533 would offer 1 bit of entropy.  Second, the number of
 * attempts it takes the algorithm to find an unused ID drastically
 * increases, killing performance.  The default value of 4096 was chosen
 * because it provides a good tradeoff between randomness and non-repetition,
 * while taking performance into account.
 *
 * With L=4096, the queue will use 8K of memory.  The bitstring always uses
 * 8K of memory (2^16/8).  This yields to around 7% ID collisions.  No memory
 * is allocated until the use of random ids is enabled.
