/*
 * Flow Control and Feedback Advisory
 *
 * Each mbuf that is being sent out through an interface is tagged with a
 * unique 32-bit ID which will help to identify all the packets that belong
 * to a particular flow at the interface layer.  Packets carrying such ID
 * would need to be marked with PKTF_FLOW_ID.  Normally, this ID is computed
 * by the module that generates the flow.  There are 3 kinds of flow sources
 * that are currently recognized:
 *
 *	a. INPCB (INET/INET6 Protocol Control Block).  When a socket is
 *	   connected, the flow hash for the socket is computed and stored in
 *	   the PCB.  Further transmissions on the socket will cause the hash
 *	   value to be carried within the mbuf as the flow ID.
 *
 *	b. Interface.  When an interface is attached, the flow hash for the
 *	   interface is computed and stored in the ifnet.  This value is
 *	   normally ignored for most network drivers, except for those that
 *	   reside atop another driver, e.g. a virtual interface performing
 *	   encapsulation/encryption on the original packet and sending the
 *	   newly-generated packet to another interface.  Such interface needs
 *	   to associate all generated packets with the interface flow hash
 *	   value as the flow ID.
 *
 *	c. PF (Packet Filter).  When a packet goes through PF and it is not
 *	   already associated with a flow ID, PF will compute a flow hash and
 *	   store it in the packet as flow ID.  When the packet is associated
 *	   with a PF state, the state record will have the flow ID stored
 *	   within, in order to avoid recalculating the flow hash.  Although PF
 *	   is capable of generating flow IDs, it does not participate in flow
 *	   advisory, and therefore packets whose IDs are computed by PF will
 *	   not have their PKTF_FLOW_ADV packet flag set.
 *
 * Activation of flow advisory mechanism is done by setting the PKTF_FLOW_ADV
 * packet flag; because a flow ID is required, the mechanism will not take
 * place unless PKTF_FLOW_ID is set as well.  The packet must also carry one
 * of the flow source types FLOWSRC_{INPCB,IFNET} in order to identify where
 * the flow advisory notification should be delivered to.  As noted above,
 * FLOWSRC_PF does not participate in this mechanism.
 *
 * The classq module configured on the interface is responsible for exerting
 * flow control to the upper layers.  This occurs when the number of packets
 * queued for a flow reaches a limit.  The module generating the flow will
 * cease transmission until further flow advisory notice, and the flow will
 * be inserted into the classq's flow control list.
 *
 * When packets are dequeued from the classq and the number of packets for
 * a flow goes below a limit, the classq will transfer its flow control list
 * to the global fadv_list.  This will then trigger the flow advisory thread
 * to run, which will cause the flow source modules to be notified that data
 * can now be generated for those previously flow-controlled flows.
